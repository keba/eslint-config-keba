eslint-config-keba-web
========

I've always disliked some of the features used in common eslintrc defaults such as airbnb, hence this version.

This is a full listing of the current ESLint config which I periodically keep up to date (and increment the version).

You may hate it. If you do hate the styling, don't use it  :)
